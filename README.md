# Audio-Tagger
Created : August 2016 

Audio Tagger uses the JAudioTagger library by JThink. It is a simple project that recursively iterates through a collection of music, using the library to find information about the artist name and title of the song. It then renames the file in the format <ARTIST NAME> - <SONG TITLE>

This was created out of a need for files to follow the same format. This makes it easy for manual search through a music collection, as well as for music players that do not (or have a bad time with) locating track metadata and instead just display the file name. For example, my car stereo :)
